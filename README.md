# GAN_MNIST_digits

The aim of this project is to create a piece of software that can create novel and plausibly hand written digits from 0 - 9.

Gan stands for Generative Adversarial Network, which is a system of 2 neiral networks, one built with the intention of creating novel artificial outputs that mimick something, often an image, the other is built with the intention of determining whether somethin, again usually an image, is artificial or real. THe two networks work similarly to an art forger and an art critic where the forger continually paints new pictures mimicking the greats and the critic continually tries to determine the real clasics from the forgers creations, each getting bettwe at their role the more they practice.

MNIST digists stands for the (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) digits dataset which is a large database of handwritten digits which is widely used for the training and testing fo machine learning algorithms.

Here we have the MNIST database of handwritten digits, a neural network that starts off by drawing random images and learns to create novel artificial versions of the handwritten deigits and a neural network whos jo it is to determine whether an input is a handwritten digit from the MNIST database or an image created by our rival neural network.
